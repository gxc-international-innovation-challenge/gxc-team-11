# The Challenge

<p>On October 1, we began participating in a virtual Innovation Challenge through the University of Applied Sciences Munich, where we worked together with the City of Munich Department of Labor & Economic Development on a digital solution for sustainable coexistence.</p>

*The challenge headline was:*

><center>"How can municipalities, through digital solutions,   motivate local companies towards climate protection, in times of crisis?"</center>

# Preparation

* Before we started thinking about the solution itself, we created a [Team Canvas](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Team-Canvas) to get to know the team better, clarify the goals and think about how we can work the most productive in the team.
* After that we defined the [Problem Statement](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Problem-Statement) to get a clear understanding of the main aspects around the problem we had to solve.

# Ideation

Within the ideation phase, we learned how to create a product with the "Working Backwards Process" from Amazon, where we start with the Customer and ends with the solution.
For that we created an [Empathy Map](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Empathy-Map) to to better understand the needs and feelings of our customers.
With a [Brainstorming Session](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Innovation-Ideas) we collected all different ideas we had, to create then an user experience [Storyboard](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Storyboard), a [Press Release](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Press-Release) and a document with frequently asked questions ([FAQ](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/FAQs)).
These steps were the foundation to start with developing of our first prototype. 

# Developing

We divided our work in two Sprints, where we created the first generation of the prototype within [Sprint1](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Sprint-1). 
With this first version we had something that we could share with the companies and others to get [feedback](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Prototype-Testing).
New ideas and the overall feedback we used in [Sprint2](https://github.com/gxc-international-innovation-challenge/gxc-team-11/wiki/Sprint-2) to improve our prototype and implement some new features.

# The Solution

Our digital solution is a carbon footprint calculator platform. The user answer questions about their business which provides data for an annual emissions estimates. Based on the data, the user is given personalized recommendations to save CO2 emissions in different areas. There is also a visualized overview, where the user can see the highest saving potentials at the first look.Our solution also provides a communication and exchange platform, where users can share ideas with other companies that are also participating.
